C
 Someone told me long ago
 There's a calm before the storm
     G                    C
 I know it's been comin' for some time
 When it's over so they say
 It'll rain a sunny day
     G                     C
 I know shinin' down like water
F            G
 I want to know
            C   C/H      Am    Am/G
 Have you ever seen the rain?
F            G
 I want to know
            C   C/H      Am    Am/G
 Have you ever seen the rain
F        G               C
 Comin' down on a sunny day?
 
 Yesterday and days before
 Sun is cold and rain is hard
 I know been that way for all my time
 'Til forever, on it goes
 Through the circle, fast and slow,
 I know it can't stop, I wonder
 
 I want to know
 Have you ever seen the rain?
 I want to know
 Have you ever seen the rain
 Comin' down on a sunny day?
 Yeah
 
 I want to know
 Have you ever seen the rain?
 I want to know
 Have you ever seen the rain
 Comin' down on a sunny day?
