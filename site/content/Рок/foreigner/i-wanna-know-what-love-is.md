Jones Michael Leslie
 
I gotta take a little time,
A little time to think things over.
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older.

Now this mountain I must climb
Feel like a world upon my shoulders
And through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
And I wanna feel, I want to feel what love is
And I know, I know you can show me

Let's talk about love

I wanna know what love is, the love that you feel inside
I want you to show me, and I'm feeling so much love
I wanna feel what love is, no, you just cannot hide
I know you can show me, yeah

I wanna know what love is, let's talk about love
I want you to show me, I wanna feel it too
I wanna feel what love is, I want to feel it too
And I know and I know, I know you can show me

Show me love is real, yeah
I wanna know what love is...

I've gotta take a little time, 
A little time to think things over.
I better read between the lines,
In case I need it when I'm older.
Now, this mountain I must climb 
Feels like the world upon my shoulders.
Through the clouds I see love shine. 
It keeps me warm as life grows colder.

    C/A    Am                C/A           Am
    In my life there's been heartache and pain.
    C/A       Am           D/A      Am
    I don't know if I can face it again.
    C/A         Am         D/A        Am 
    Can't stop now. I've traveled so far 
         C          G/B    Am G C/D
    To change this lonely life.

G Em D 2 Am Em D 2
I want to know what love is. I want you to show me.
G Em D 2 Am Em D D7 1 Em 1
I want to feel what love is. I know you can show me.
I'm gonna take a little time, a little time to look around me.
I've got nowhere to hide. It looks like love has fin'lly found me.
