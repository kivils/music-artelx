Bm G Em F#
Bm G Em F#

Bm           G          Em      F#
Blinded by science, I'm on the run.
Blinded by science, where do I belong?
What's in the future, has it just begun?
Blinded by science, I'm on the run.

Bm                 G
I worry 'bout the world that we live in,
Em             F#
I'm worried by all the confusion.
Bm                  G
I wonder 'bout the lies I've been reading,
Em                   F#
I wonder where this madness is leading.

A#         C
Is this a road going nowhere
or is someone leading us somewhere?
I can't believe we're here for no reason,
there must be something I can believe in.

Bm           G          Em      F#
Blinded by science, I'm on the run.
I'm not an appliance, so don't turn me on.
What's in the future, has it just begun?
Blinded by science, I'm on the run.

What's in the future, has it just begun?
Blinded by science, I'm on the run.

I'm worried by the world that we live in,
I'm worried by all the confusion.
I wonder 'bout the lies I've been reading,
I wonder where this madness is leading.

Is this a road going nowhere
or is someone leading us somewhere?
I can't believe were here for no reason,
there must be something I can believe in.

Blinded by science, I'm on the run. (ON THE RUN)
I'm not an appliance, so don't turn me on. (TURN ME ON)
What's in the future, has it just begun?
Blinded by science, I'm on the run.

Bm           G          Em      F#
Blinded by science, I'm on the run.
Bm               G     Em  F#  Bm
I'm blinded by science on the run.
